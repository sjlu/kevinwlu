I am honored to be a candidate for the 2014-2015 ComSoc VP of <a href="http://www.comsoc.org/about/boards/standards" target="_new">Standards Activities</a>. The 2012-2013 <a href="http://cms.comsoc.org/eprise/main/SiteGen/Standards_Board/Content/Home.html" target="_new">ComSoc Standards Development Board</a> has already received several approvals by the <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/index.html">IEEE-SA Standards Board</a>, including DySPAN Standards Committee as a Sponsor, individual standards balloting processes for 1903 and 1907.1 Working Groups, joint sponsorship for P1858, and the new ComSoc SDB policies and procedures with a sustainable financial model. We can still move further.

In support of the strategic directions articulated by the ComSoc leadership, I am committed to broadening opportunities for engaging members in relevant, timely, and useful standards. We can systematically facilitate early and frequent communications between standards developers and users in all phases of standards activities, including:

<ul>
	<li>Needs identification, assessment, and selection.</li>
	<li>Standards development, implementation, and maintenance.</li>
	<li>International standards harmonization.</li>
	<li>Standards testing and deployment support.</li>
	<li>Standards training modules and outreach program.</li>
</ul>

In addition, timeliness and adaptability of the standards development process are critical to the standardsâ€™ relevance and usefulness since both user needs and technologies are rapidly evolving. We can use online communications to further expedite contribution, peer review, discussion, revision, and publication. Most important, I want to know your ideas on improving our standards activities, and any current and ongoing issues that you care about.
