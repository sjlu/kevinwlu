        <h1>Standards Activities</h1>
        <div class="content"><p>Members of the IEEE Communications Society (<a href="http://www.comsoc.org/" target="_blank">ComSoc</a>) have contributed significantly to technology advances such as 5G, machine-to-machine Communications, network functions virtualization, software-defined networking, and the internet of things. At the same time, <a href="http://www.comsoc.org/boards/industry-standards-activities" target="_blank">ComSoc Industry and Standards Activities Boards</a> continue to facilitate the progress from research to standards by members’ dedication and contribution to research groups, study groups, working groups, and ballot groups on communications standards. Recurring standards workshops and publications have provided members with opportunities to collaborate and stay informed.

        As an Advisor to the <a href="http://comsdb.standards.comsoc.org/" target="_blank">ComSoc Standards Development Board</a>, I am committed to further broadening opportunities for engaging members in relevant, timely, and useful standards. In addition to face-to-face meetings, we can conduct online communications among researchers, standards developers, and practitioners in all phases of Standards Activities:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Needs identification, assessment, and selection</li>
          <li>Liaison to relevant alliances, consortia, and other standards development organizations</li>
          <li>Standards development, implementation, and maintenance</li>
          <li>International standards harmonization</li>
          <li>Standards testing and deployment support</li>
          <li>Standards training modules and outreach program</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Timeliness and adaptability are critical to the standards’ relevance and usefulness since markets and technologies are rapidly evolving. We can facilitate collaborations among members to further expedite contribution, peer review, discussion, revision, and publication. Most importantly, I want to know your ideas for standards, and emerging technologies that you care about.</p>
